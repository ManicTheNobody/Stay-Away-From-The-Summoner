Theme: Summoning
Ideas:
 - Click to summon little guys
  - Ant summoner?
 - Summoning as traversal?
 - STAY AWAY FROM THE SUMMONER:
  - Avoid getting summoned to the material plane by evading the devilish summoner who follows you
  - You yourself are a summoner who can conjure little fellas to impede the court summoner
  - End goal/Victory state:
    - In every level, there is a task you must complete for some NPC while evading the summoner
      - BIG MIKE

  - Gameplay:
    - Top-down dealio?
      - Collect Hell Crystals by beating the Devilish timed challenges
      - Evade the Summoner who is trying to Summon you to a mage
        - Summon your own minions and disguises to slow him down
      - Return the Hell Crystals to Big Mike who requires a certain amount to subsume your contract
      - Watch Big Mike get summoned away, rinse repeat
